# schedulingattentionmodel SAM
The codes for the paper published in JMS named 'Solving task scheduling problems in cloud manufacturing via attention mechanism and deep reinforcement learning'. 

This repository is a minimal implementation of SAM. Parts of the codes are from 'https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route.git'. 

The core idea is to improve the scheduling performance for the task scheduling in cloud manufacturing with the attention mechanism. 
Detailed motivations and introductions can be found in our paper as listed above.
